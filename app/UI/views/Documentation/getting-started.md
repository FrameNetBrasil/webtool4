# Getting Started

Welcome to the Webtool 4.2 Documentation. This guide will help you understand the linguistic annotation and FrameNet management system.

## Overview

Webtool 4.2 is a comprehensive platform for linguistic annotation and frame semantic analysis. It provides tools for:

- **Frame Management**: Create and manage semantic frames
- **Lexical Unit Annotation**: Annotate words and phrases with frame information
- **Corpus Analysis**: Work with text corpora and multimodal content
- **Visualization**: Interactive graphs and semantic networks

## Key Concepts

### Frames

Frames are conceptual structures that describe types of events, relations, or states and the participants in them.

### Frame Elements

Frame elements (FEs) are the semantic roles or participants in a frame. They can be:

- **Core**: Essential participants
- **Peripheral**: Optional participants
- **Extra-thematic**: Elements that relate the frame to larger discourse context

### Lexical Units

Lexical units are words or phrases that evoke a particular frame. For example, "buy" and "purchase" both evoke the Commerce_buy frame.
