# Comprehensive Guide to Croft's Flat Syntax CE Labels

## PHRASAL CE LABELS
*Labels for elements within phrases (word-level components)*

| Label | Full Name | Definition | Function | Examples from Paper | Additional Examples |
|-------|-----------|------------|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Head** | Head | The核心 element of a phrase that determines its referential or semantic properties; can stand alone as a minimal phrase | Denotes the referent or core meaning; syntactically required element | • "brothers" in "The two **brothers**"<br>• "lose" in "might **lose**"<br>• "competition" in "the **competition**" | • "dog" in "the big **dog**"<br>• "quickly" in "very **quickly**"<br>• Single-word phrases are annotated as Head (§3.1) |
| **Mod** | Modifier | Elements that specify, describe, or delimit the head referent; includes articles, demonstratives, numerals, quantifiers, adjectives | Restricts or elaborates the reference/meaning of the head | • "The two" in "**The two** brothers"<br>• "the" in "**the** game"<br>• "a rare but aggressive" in "**a rare but aggressive** cancer" (Table 3) | • "big" in "the **big** dog"<br>• "this" in "**this** book"<br>• "three" in "**three** cats"<br>• Subtypes not distinguished: Art, Dem, Num, Adj all labeled Mod (§3.1) |
| **Adm** | Admodifier | Modifiers of modifiers; degree words, intensifiers, downtoners, hedging elements that modify adjectives, adverbs, or other modifiers | Grades or qualifies the property expressed by a modifier | • "very" in "a **very** large tree" (Table 2)<br>• "almost" in "**almost** fifty" (§2.1) | • "extremely" in "**extremely** hot"<br>• "quite" in "**quite** interesting"<br>• "somewhat" in "**somewhat** difficult"<br>• No separate attributive phrase level created (§2.1) |
| **Adp** | Adposition | Prepositions or postpositions; mark spatial, temporal, or abstract relations between phrases | Strategy for expressing modification or argument relations | • "on" in "**on** top of" (before becoming MWE)<br>• "on" in "fell **on** {our} house" (Table 4) | • English: **in**, **at**, **from**, **to**<br>• Turkish: ev-**de** 'house-at' (postposition)<br>• Found in phrases but indicate clause-level CEs (§3.2, Table 7) |
| **Lnk** | Linker | Grammatical elements connecting modifiers to heads; linking particles or morphemes | Strategy for marking modification relationships | • Spanish "de" in possessive constructions<br>• Tagalog linker particles (implied from typological context) | • Mandarin "de" (的): hóng **de** shū 'red **DE** book'<br>• Malay "yang": rumah **yang** besar 'house **THAT** big'<br>• Found in both phrasal and clausal contexts (Tables 6-7) |

## SENTENTIAL CE LABELS
*Labels for elements within sentences (clause-level components)*

| Label | Full Name | Definition | Function | Examples from Paper | Additional Examples |
|-------|-----------|------------|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Main** | Main Clause | Clauses expressing pragmatically asserted events/states; independent clauses that could stand alone | Primary assertion in the utterance | • Both clauses in coordinate structure: "lose the game # **and** + exit the competition" (both labeled Main in Table 1) | • "I ate" in "**I ate** and left"<br>• "She left" in "**She left**"<br>• May occur with subordinate clauses: "**I left** when he arrived"<br>• Distinguished by assertion, not morphosyntax alone (§4.1) |
| **Adv** | Adverbial Clause | Subordinate clauses expressing temporal, causal, conditional, or other circumstantial relations to main event | Provides circumstantial/temporal/causal background | • "after + I + ate" in "**after + I + ate** # I + left" (ex. 14a)<br>• "If you do that" in "**If you do that**, the terrorists have won" (ex. 22d) | • "when he arrived" in "I left **when he arrived**"<br>• "because she was exhausted" in "She went to bed **because she was exhausted**" (ex. 22b)<br>• "Although John had no money" in "**Although John had no money**, he went into this restaurant" (ex. 22e) |
| **Rel** | Relative Clause | Clauses functioning as modifiers of nominal referents; attributive clauses | Restricts or describes the referent of a noun phrase | • "that + fell + on {our} house" in "The tree {**that + fell + on {our} house**} had + died" (Table 4)<br>• "that + Gollum + had + lost" in "the ring # **that + Gollum + had + lost**" (ex. 16) | • "who is tall" in "the man **who is tall**"<br>• "that I bought" in "the bicycle **that I bought**" (§3.2)<br>• May interrupt matrix clause (center-embedding) or follow head (§4.2.1) |
| **Comp** | Complement Clause | Clauses functioning as arguments of predicates; complete propositions filling argument slots | Serves as subject, object, or complement of matrix predicate | • "that + he + resigned" in "It + isn't + surprising # **that + he + resigned**" (ex. 35b)<br>• "to believe the girl" in "wants **to believe the girl**" (ex. 6, AMR example) | • "that I bought a bicycle" in "I told her **that I bought a bicycle**" (§3.2)<br>• "to leave" in "She wants **to leave**"<br>• May occur with utterance, attitude, perception, modal verbs (§4.2.2) |
| **Dtch** | Detached Phrase | Phrases that are pragmatically foregrounded as topics or foci; not integrated into clause argument structure | Marks pragmatic status (topic/focus) separate from clausal structure | • Mentioned in §3.1 as "topic and focus phrases, sometimes analyzed as separate from clauses"<br>• Listed in Table 5 but not exemplified | • **"John"**, I saw him" (left-dislocated topic)<br>• "I saw him, **John**" (right-dislocated)<br>• "**As for Mary**, she left early"<br>• "**Beans**, I don't like" (fronted focus)<br>• May have special marking (morphemes/intonation) |
| **Int** | Interactive | Heine's (2023) category including interjections, discourse markers, response signals, social formulae, vocatives | Manages discourse flow and interaction rather than propositional content | • Categories from Heine listed in (11): attention signals (**look**, **hey**), directives (**hang on**), discourse markers (**anyway**, **I mean**), evaluatives (**good gracious**), etc. | • "well" in "**Well**, I think so"<br>• "you know" in "I was, **you know**, tired"<br>• "ouch" in "**Ouch!** That hurt"<br>• "hello" in "**Hello**, how are you?"<br>• "Dad" in "**Dad**, can I go?"<br>• May be words or phrases (§2.1, §3.1) |

## KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE LABELS

### 1. **Deliberate Under-specification** (§3.1)
Croft intentionally does NOT distinguish subtypes:
- **Mod** does NOT differentiate: Article, Demonstrative, Numeral, Adjective
- **Arg** does NOT differentiate: Subject, Object, Oblique (or Ergative, Absolutive, etc.)
- **CPP** does NOT differentiate: Auxiliary, manner adverb, tense marker, etc.

**Rationale**: Simplicity for cross-linguistic application; detailed info recoverable from:
- Glosses (morphological categories in IMT)
- Lexicon (word classes)
- Word order patterns

### 2. **Strategy vs. Role Distinction** (Table 5)
- **Roles**: Semantic/functional relations (Head, Mod, Pred, Arg, etc.)
- **Strategies**: Formal means of expressing relations (Adp, Lnk, Clf, Idx, Conj)

Strategies may appear at multiple levels but serve the construction at the higher level:
- **Adp** is phrasal CE but marks clausal relations (§3.2, Table 7, footnote *)
- **Conj** appears at both phrasal and clausal levels

### 3. **Three-Tier Labeling** (§3.1)
Labels organized by construction size:
- **Phrasal CEs** = "lexical" tier (word-level elements)
- **Clausal CEs** = "phrasal" tier (phrase-level elements + some words)
- **Sentential CEs** = "clausal" tier (clause-level elements + some phrases/words)

This creates a **fixed-depth annotation** compatible with tabular formats.

### 4. **Pragmatic vs. Morphosyntactic Basis** (§4.1)
Key theoretical point:
- **Main vs. subordinate** = pragmatic distinction (asserted vs. non-asserted), NOT purely syntactic
- Same morphosyntax may serve different pragmatic functions (insubordination, ex. 24-26)
- Same pragmatic function may use different morphosyntax (coordinate vs. subordinate, ex. 22)

Labels reflect **functional categories** more than formal ones.

### 5. **Cross-linguistic Applicability**
Labels designed to apply across languages:
- Avoid English-specific categories (e.g., no "article" subtype, since not all languages have articles)
- Use comparative concepts (Haspelmath 2010) that can be identified cross-linguistically
- Rely on universal or near-universal distinctions (predication, reference, modification)

## ANNOTATION WORKFLOW WITH LABELS

### Input Text:
```
The tree that fell on our house also wrecked your car.
```

### Step 1: Boundary Markers (§2)
```
The tree + {that + fell + on {our} house} also + wrecked + your + car .
```

### Step 2: Three-Tier CE Labels (§3)
```
Analyzed Text:  The tree + {that + fell + on {our} house} also + wrecked + your + car .
Phrasal CEs:    Mod Head   Head   Head  Adp Head Head  Head   Head     Head  Head Head
Clausal CEs:    Arg        Conj   Pred  Arg   Gen    CPP    Pred      Gen   Arg
Sentential CEs: Main       Rel                        Main
```

This table format (compatible with CLDF) provides:
- **Row 1**: Word-level segmentation with boundary markers
- **Row 2**: Phrasal-level roles (what role does each word play in its phrase?)
- **Row 3**: Clausal-level roles (what role does each phrase play in its clause?)
- **Row 4**: Sentential-level roles (what role does each clause play in the sentence?)
